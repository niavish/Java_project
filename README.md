/************ NOTES *************************/

Object Oritented Concept: 
 - OOPS is a method of designing and implementing software.
 - The primary purpose of object oriented programming is to increase the flexibility and maintainability


 Class : 
 - It's a group of similar entities
 -  A class doesn't consume any memory space.

 Object : 
 - An object can be defined as an instance of a class.
 - An object contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
 - An object has three characteristics. It has a 
    i. state : state represnts the data of object 
    ii. behavior : represents the action of an object such as start, stop etc
    iii. identity : Identity is used internally by the Java Virtual machine to identify each object uniquely.


Methods :

type of methods 
1. Stand alone methods
2. User defined methods

  Method Return Types :
   1. Void : Returns nothing
   2. Primitive : Returns char, byte, short, int , long, boolean, float, double
   3. Non-primitive : Returns reference data types (such as objcet of Class, String, etc.)


Method overloading :
 When a class has two or more methods by the same name, but different parameters, its known as method overloading.

Constructor :
 - constructors have no explicit return type. 
 - a class can have more than one constructor.
